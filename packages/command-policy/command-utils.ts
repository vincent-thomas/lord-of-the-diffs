/**
 * command-utils.ts — shell command parsing used by the matching engine.
 *
 * This is a self-contained copy of the same-named module in this repo's
 * pi/lib/ (@vt-pi/lib) — kept duplicated on purpose so this package has no
 * dependency on anything else in the vt-pi workspace, only on
 * @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent. See pi/lib/command-utils.test.ts for the
 * exhaustive parser test suite; this copy is exercised indirectly through
 * matching.test.ts and predicates.test.ts.
 *
 * The goal is to find the *real* executable a shell segment runs, seeing
 * through environment-variable prefixes (`FOO=bar cmd`), command wrappers
 * (`sudo`, `env`, …), absolute paths (`/bin/cat`), alias-busting backslashes
 * (`\cat`), and to look inside pipelines and command substitutions.
