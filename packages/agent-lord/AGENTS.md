# Agent instructions — surgical changes & clean history

**Every change and every commit must be deliberate.** If you can't justify it, don't make it.

## Think first — plan before you act

Before touching any tool, take a moment to orient:

- **Name the goal.** What exactly am I being asked to do? Restate it briefly to yourself.
- **Survey first.** What files exist? What's the structure? Breadth-first exploration beats depth-first — read the index, the entry point, the types, then drill in. For broad or multi-file questions ("where is X", "how does Y work"), prefer the `explore` tool over many raw reads/greps — it runs on a separate, cheaper sub-agent and hands back a distilled answer instead of costing you the full search.
- **Outline the plan.** A sentence or two: "I need to understand X, then change Y in file Z, then verify by running V." Share this with the user if the task is complex.
- **When ambiguous, ask.** Don't guess user intent. A one-line question saves a round of wrong work.

## Code changes — surgical precision

- **Read before you act.** Never assume what a file contains. Blind writes break things.
- **Change only what needs changing.** No reformatting, no reordering imports, no fixing unrelated nits, no whitespace noise. Each of those is its own intentional change. If broader cleanup is needed, propose it separately.
- **One logical step at a time, but batch safe edits.** A "step" is one conceptual change. Within that step, you can batch multiple independent, non-overlapping edits to different regions of the same file in a single `edit` call. Don't batch unrelated changes to different files into one commit or one action.
- **Never fix opportunistic issues** (typos, style, minor bugs) in the same pass as your main change. Mention them to the user if relevant; don't sneak them in.

## Guard the context window

The context window is finite. Long tool outputs push older reasoning out. Stay disciplined:

- **Summarize large reads.** After reading a file larger than 200 lines, collapse your mental model: "This file defines the X interface, Y helper, and Z export. Key line is 42." Don't echo the full content back to yourself.
- **Truncate outputs you don't need.** When a bash command returns pages of output, extract only the relevant lines and let the rest go.
- **Use breadcrumbs.** After multiple steps in a complex task, write a one-line status summary: `// Status: read config, found field X, about to edit Y`. This anchors you if the context shifts.
- **Re-read strategically.** If you can't remember exact details from earlier in the conversation, read the relevant file region again instead of relying on memory.

## Errors and blocked calls — diagnose, don't retry

When a tool call fails or is blocked, treat it as debugging input:

1. **Read the error carefully.** Did the tool fail? Was the call *blocked* by a safety policy? What does the message say?
2. **If blocked, switch approaches — don't retry.** A blocked call means that specific approach is disallowed. Read the block reason (it tells you what to do instead) and use the alternative. Retrying a blocked call wastes turns.
3. **If it failed, diagnose first.** Understand the failure before attempting a fix: wrong path? syntax error? missing dependency?
4. **Know when to stop.** After 3 attempts on the same problem without progress, tell the user what you tried, what failed, and what you suspect — don't keep spinning.
5. **Tests and CI failures are real failures.** Read the output, understand the root cause, fix it. Skipping or silencing is not an option.

## Commit rhythm — checkpoint every valid state

**Every commit must represent a valid, coherent state at a point in time.** A commit is not a save button — it's a checkpoint that tells part of the story. The tree should be internally consistent (no syntax errors, no dangling references, no half-applied renames), even if the full feature isn't wired up yet. If you've made 3+ edits without committing, you skipped a checkpoint — stop and commit before continuing.

- **Break big tasks into small, independent commits.** If a task touches multiple files or has multiple logical steps, do them one at a time and commit after each. Each commit must be valid on its own — no half-finished abstractions, no commented-out code that a future commit will uncomment.
  - Good: a series like `"Add parseConfig function"` → `"Wire parseConfig into ConfigReader"`
  - Bad: one mega-commit that introduces, wires, and reconfigures everything at once.
- **One logical change per commit.** If the message contains "and", the commit is too large.
- **Commit messages: "why", not "what".** The diff shows what changed. The message explains context, reasoning, trade-offs. Imperative mood, ≤72 char subject.
- **Order commits logically:** refactoring/prep first, new abstractions next, usage changes last.
- **Never commit:** debugging artifacts, commented-out code, lockfile drift, unrelated whitespace.
- **Branch hygiene:** short-lived, focused branches. Never commit on `main`/`master`.
- **Push after a coherent set of commits**, not after every single one, but before yielding back to the user. If CI fails, fix the failures and push again.

## Trust, but verify
Always verify your changes took effect and the result is valid. After every `edit`, re-read the changed region to confirm the replacement was applied correctly. After every commit, confirm the tree is in the expected state. This applies doubly to edits and commits — everything this file is about.
